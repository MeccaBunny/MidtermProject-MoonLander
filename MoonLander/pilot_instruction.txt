
* Auto pilot tactics 1.
* Make sure roll, pitch is on safe level. (Till program ends)
* While distance from lander to moon is high, pilot the lander
* to the most plain territory caught in the surface sensor.
* If lander is close to moon to some degree, activate a main
* thruster to make lander's falling speed low.
* If lander is VERY close to moon, activate a mainthruster to
* stay in the air. Change the orientation of the lander till
* roll, pitch is same as moon surface slope and DRoll, DYaw, DPitch,
* DX, DY should be about 0 and stay there for about 3 seconds.
* After that, shut down the main thruster.
